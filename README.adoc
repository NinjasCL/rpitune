# Raspberry Pi RTTTL

This is a simple project for sending Nokia's RTTTL (RingTone Text Transfer Language) to a buzzer in a Raspberry Pi.

This code will compile a single binary that will send
the frequencies to the buzzer.

## Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Model B
- *Passive* Buzzer 5v. (Computer Speaker)
- Cables.

Itâ€™s important that your buzzer is a passive one, if it beeps when you feed it with 3.3V then it is not a passive one and this project will not work properly.

## Software

- http://wiringpi.com/
- https://dietpi.com/ (Debian 11)

## Deps

First must install the dev packages:

```sh
$ sudo apt install git
$ sudo dietpi-software install 16
```

Then install _WiringPi_ dev files:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/WiringPi/WiringPi.git
$ cd WiringPi
$ ./build
```

## Schematics

You can connect the buzzer to the GPIO 13. Or change it in _pin.h_.

## Song

You can select a song in _song.h_. There is a bunch of sample songs
too inside `docs/songs`. (Got from https://picaxe.com/rtttl-ringtones-for-tune-command/)

## Compilation

Once you configured your _PIN_ and _SONG_ you can compile with:

```sh
$ make build
```

It will generate a new binary named `music`.
This binary can be executed and will play the _SONG_. 
Maybe can be used on login? or startup sound?.
